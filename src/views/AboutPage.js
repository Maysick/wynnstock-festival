        <p class="lead">Wynnstock Festival started off as a community project to test how initial and final design roles can be incorporated into a fanmade expansion. This experiment was not a failure, but we did learn many things along the way.
            This project was actually started in the beginning of 2019, but had some major hiatuses and reworks (we had to change our original keyword after Twinspell was revealed)! Many thanks to all of those who contributed to the set, those who
            reviewed cards, and of course Team 5 for creating the game we all love so much. Hopefully you enjoyed Wynnstock, and thank you for viewing the set.
